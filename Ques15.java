/**
 * 
 * Identify the logic behind the series
 * 
 * 6 28 66 120 190 276â€¦.
 * 
 * The numbers in the series should be used to create a Pyramid. The base of the
 * Pyramid will be the widest and will start converging towards the top where
 * there will only be one element. Each successive layer will have one number
 * less than that on the layer below it. The width of the Pyramid is specified
 * by an input parameter N. In other words there will be N numbers on the bottom
 * layer of the pyramid.
 * 
 * The Pyramid construction rules are as follows
 * 
 * First number in the series should be at the top of the Pyramid Last N number
 * of the series should be on the bottom-most layer of the Pyramid, with Nth
 * number being the right-most number of this layer. Numbers less than 5-digits
 * must be padded with zeroes to maintain the sanctity of a Pyramid when
 * printed. Have a look at the examples below to get a pictorial understanding
 * of what this rule actually means. Example
 * 
 * If input is 2, output will be
 * 
 * 00006 00028 00066 If input is 3, output will be
 * 
 * 00006 00028 00066 00120 00190 00276 Formal input and output specifications
 * are stated below
 * 
 * Input Format:
 * 
 * First line of input will contain number N that corresponds to the width of
 * the bottom-most layer of the Pyramid Output Format:
 * 
 * The Pyramid constructed out of numbers in the series as per stated
 * construction rules Constraints:
 * 
 * 0 < N <= 14
